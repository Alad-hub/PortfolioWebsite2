  <h1>Future</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>Up Next</h3>
  <p title="looking at how Teams is down all the time, we could definitely use more Informatikers">I plan on doing BMS alongside my apprenticeship, and thereafter obtain my Pasarelle in order to be able to attend a universiy here and further pursue my educational prowess.
    <br>
  Alternatively, I could find a position and begin working right away.
    <br>
    Nothing is set in stone, It's the distant future after all.
    For now, I'm still looking for a place that's right for me, and vice versa.
    If you're reading this, you could just be the place, so please give me a shot!

  <h3>Appreciation</h3>

  <p title="no more easter eggs, just a heartfelt thank you!">
    Thank you very much for spending the time to go through my little Portfolio, as well as my other documents.
    <br>
    I would be delighted to have either a personal interview with you, or better, have the chance to come over and do a
    Schnupperlehre.
    I look forward to your feedback.<br>
    I wish you a wonderful day.
  </p>
