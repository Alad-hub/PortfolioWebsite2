  <h3>Passion</h3>
  <p title="I love tech videos, do you know Mrwhosetheboss?">
    Even as a child I've always been passionate about technology, Smartphones, Computers, Laptops, TVs, Monitors, VR, AR, the list goes on. <br>
    However, I only ever got familiar with programming after buying my first laptop in 2023.
    I knew I had to do something here as a career, and in my mind I'd always played with the thought of being a programmer.
    After trying it first-hand I realized that this could be the job for me. <br>
    It had its own challenges but I liked doing it. <br>
    to analyze problems, come up with solutions, trying different things and even getting creative along the way. It was
    all rather enjoyable for me.

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p title="there's no free lunch">
    After becoming more familiar with the system here, I realized that the competition for an Informatiker
    Apprenticeship is <b>very fierce.</b><br>
    I was nowhere near competent enough, so I got to work. <br>
    I did research, partook in numerous Schnupperlehren, took on different programming courses (Web-Development, Game-Development
    and App-Development) and even started learning Python by myself at home. <br>
    Naturally I also needed to learn German, and most importantly, I needed a Sekundarabschlusszeugnis. <br>
    I attended the Fachschule Viventa and studied for a year to have a shot at the exams, <strong>said exams take place
      in October.</strong>
